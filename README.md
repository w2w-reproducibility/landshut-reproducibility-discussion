# Computational reproducibility

## Resources

[**The Practice of Reproducible Research**](https://www.gitbook.com/book/bids/the-practice-of-reproducible-research/details): A great e-book with some basic practices for computational reproducibility - easy to implement for everyone - and a lot of detailed case studies.

**Damien Irving's work**: His [BAMS paper](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-D-15-00010.1) on how to write a reproducible article and an accompanying [blog post](https://drclimate.wordpress.com/2016/06/16/how-to-write-a-reproducible-paper/) on his website.

[**Reproducible Research Coursera course**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research): A course on reproducibility mostly focused on R.

**Greg Wilson's papers**: [Best](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745) and [Good Enough](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510) Practices for Scientific Computing. Fantastic tipps and tricks for coding. Easy to read and implement.

[**Stephan's convective variability Github repository**](https://github.com/raspstephan/convective_variability_analysis): Example repository for a reproducible paper. Note that this is just one way to approach computational reproducibility. There are doubtless many other and many better ways of doing this.

[**Jupyter notebooks**](http://jupyter.org/) and [**R Markdown**](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/): Tools for literate programming.

[**Victoria Stodden**](http://web.stanford.edu/~vcs/index.html): One of the people at the forefront of the reproducibility movement.
